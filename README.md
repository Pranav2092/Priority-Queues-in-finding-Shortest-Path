# Priority-Queues-in-finding-Shortest-Path

In this project we have implemented the priority queues using 3 different heaps:
  1. Binomial Heap
  2. Height-Balanced Leftist Heap
  3. Min-Max Heap
Using these different prioirtiy queues we are implementing the A* algorithm for pathfinding in the graph.Then we are comparing the performances of the different implementtions using the runtime of each implementation based on the following metrics:
  1. Number of nodes
  2. Density of graph
  3. Weight allocated to the heuristic
For the comapritive study we are generating a random dataset using our customized generator function.
We have implemented our project in C++ language.
